# A Transformer-based network for deforestation detection from bitemporal optical images

## Previous Deforestation Map Generator
Generate .tif previous deforestation temporal distance map. As older is the deforestation, the value is close to 0. As recent is the deforestation, the value is close to 1

  --image-1 IMAGE_1     Path to optical image (.tif) file of year 1
  --image-2 IMAGE_2     Path to optical image (.tif) file of year 2
  -t TILES, --tiles TILES
                        Path to the tiles file (.tif)
